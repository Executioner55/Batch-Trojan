Good day, the reason for this project is that im annoyed,
on GitHub that there seems to be no one at least in the batch area 
who knows the difference between trojans and viruses.

greetings to :

1. https://github.com/Bifftanner/Batchfile-trojan-horse/blob/main/trojan.bat
2. https://github.com/pankoza-pl/batchtrojangenerator
3. https://github.com/VarunBanka/trojan
4. https://github.com/VSNOOB/ActualDangerousTrojanVirus/blob/main/ultimatecrash.bat

1. "Trojan" in the code itself it says "Title DDoSer and ip grabber!"
2. Virus!=Trojan
3. Didnt knew that a "Wifi password cracker" is a Trojan.
4. Never saw a better Virus... but still no Trojan. (Joking of course its shit)
