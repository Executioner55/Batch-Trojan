Good day, the reason for this project is that im annoyed,<br />
on GitHub that there seems to be no one at least in the batch area <br />
who knows the difference between trojans and viruses.<br />

greetings to :

https://github.com/Bifftanner/Batchfile-trojan-horse/blob/main/trojan.bat- "Trojan" in the code itself it says "Title DDoSer and ip grabber!"<br />
https://github.com/pankoza-pl/batchtrojangenerator                       - Virus!=Trojan<br />
https://github.com/VarunBanka/trojan                                     - didnt knew that a "Wifi password cracker" is a Trojan.<br />
https://github.com/VSNOOB                                                - Never saw a better Virus... but still no Trojan. (Joking of course its shit)<br />
